  # tags, so the stray single-component "v1" tag is ignored. url :stable is
  # required by FormulaAudit/LivecheckUrlSymbol; github_latest derives the repo
  # from it, and the semver regex is a defensive filter on the release tag.

    <<~EOS
      lintro is a lightweight standalone binary (no Python required).

      Install tools with:
        lintro doctor
        lintro install --profile recommended

      For all tools bundled via Homebrew dependencies:
        brew install lgtm-hq/tap/lintro-full
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/lintro --version")
    # Help output renders emoji; brew test's ASCII locale crashes the
    # binary with UnicodeEncodeError, so force UTF-8 inline (an ENV
    # assignment does not reach the subprocess).
    utf8 = "LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8"
    assert_match "Usage:", shell_output("#{utf8} #{bin}/lintro --help")
    # `lintro doctor` reports tool status and may exit non-zero when optional
    # tools are missing, so assert on its output rather than the exit status.
    doctor_cmd = "#{utf8} #{bin}/lintro doctor 2>&1"
