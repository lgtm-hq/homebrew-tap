  # Track the latest GitHub release via the releases API rather than scanning all

  # required by FormulaAudit/LivecheckUrlSymbol; github_latest derives the repo
  # from it, and the semver regex is a defensive filter on the release tag.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      lintro is a lightweight standalone binary (no Python required).

      Install tools with:
        lintro doctor
        lintro install --profile recommended

      For all tools bundled via Homebrew dependencies:
        brew install lgtm-hq/tap/lintro-full
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/lintro --version")
    assert_match "Usage:", shell_output("#{bin}/lintro --help")
    # `lintro doctor` reports tool status and may exit non-zero when optional
    # tools are missing, so assert on its output rather than the exit status.
    # Doctor prints emoji: the inline PYTHONIOENCODING survives brew test's
    # scrubbed ASCII environment where an ENV assignment does not.
    assert_match "Lintro Doctor", pipe_output("PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 #{bin}/lintro doctor 2>&1")
