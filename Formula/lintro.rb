  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      lintro is a lightweight install: a standalone binary on Apple silicon
      (no Python required) and a PyPI virtualenv on Intel Macs.

      Install tools with:
        lintro doctor
        lintro install --profile recommended

      For all tools bundled via Homebrew dependencies:
        brew install lgtm-hq/tap/lintro-full
    EOS

    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/lintro --version")

    # binary with UnicodeEncodeError, so force UTF-8 inline (an ENV
    # assignment does not reach the subprocess).
    utf8 = "LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8"
    assert_match "Usage:", shell_output("#{utf8} #{bin}/lintro --help")
    # `lintro doctor` reports tool status and may exit non-zero when optional
    # tools are missing, so assert on its output rather than the exit status.
